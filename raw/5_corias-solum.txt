His ears were still ringing as he ran through the cobblestone streets, the path ahead lit by the buzzing street-lights on either side of him.

The crowd that Cy wended through thickened the further he proceeded through the outer rim of Corias Solum, which was still possessed of that simple prestige from its days when it was but a small mining colony.

The brick houses he flashed by were about thrice his height. The grey puffs of smoke spitting out the chimneys were nothing compared to the pitch-black streams of grey clouds streaming into the sky from the factories located nearer the heart of the city.

This was one of the reasons why Viridia had always disliked being dragged to the city by her mother and father in her youth. She sighed wistfully at the starless sky above. Pushing her way through the crowd and into a smelly alleyway, Viridia pulled her hood closer to her.

On the cold ground, was a shaggy, unwashed man, his eyes red and his bearded face sagging. He held out his vile, infected fingers which Viridia quickly side-stepped. Behind a dumpster, a pack of street urchins were half-crouched into a circle, muttering to each other. They stopped only to glare as Viridia passed. Leaning against a wall with his arms crossed was a straw-haired man in an overcoat and a hat that obscured his eyes. He did not seem to register Viridia's appearance; he might have even been sleeping.

"There you are!"

A loud thud behind Viridia made her turn around. The man in the coat zoomed towards her, sword drawn. Cy took Viridia by the arm and with his other, seized the man's sword arm. Relinquishing Viridia, Cy placed his palm onto the handle of his own blade. But he did not draw it. "If you want to cause trouble here," he whispered to the man, "the Shadow Sentinels will no doubt catch wind of this. I assure you that this is something we do not desire. Now put it away."

The man tilted his head from Cy's sword and then to his imploring face. He walked back and face still in shadow, leaned back against the wall as motionless and uncaring as ever. The gang of children were watching Viridia, each ready to pull something out of a pocket in their shorts.

"C'mon," said Cy, hooking Viridia's arm into his.

"Hey!" said Viridia before Cy reared and jumped onto an alley wall and ricocheted onto the wall opposite. They landed atop a flat ceramic rooftop. Viridia climbed to her feet.

"What were you thinking, ditching me like that?" said Cy, as Viridia checked her sleeves. "You heard the guard. If the Shadow Sentinels find you without your escort, then they'll throw you right back out, or even worse!"

Tossing the Book of Banes at Viridia, Cy gestured to a large chapel-like silhouette. "The library is that way," he said as he started into a run. Stuffing her book in her sleeve, Viridia followed suit.

As they jumped from rooftop to rooftop, the details of the library became more and more pronounced not by moonlight, but by the light emanating from a nearby procession. Unlike the buildings surrounding it, the library of Corias Solum was made of carved stone rather than cast metal. Its four steepled towers were the only things that were taller than the walls enclosing the city. The light bounced off the mosaic at the top of an entrance; an unknown carving flashed briefly beneath Viridia's eyes.

"So what did you mean earlier," panted Viridia, who had insisted that they catch their breath, "when the Shadow Sentinels might do something even worse than throwing us out of the city?"

"It's not safe to talk about it now," said Cy, casting glances around the neighboring rooftops. "I'll explain once we're out of the city."

Viridia narrowed her eyes, then crouched onto the ledge, her legs huddled up against her. She slowly allowed her gaze to drift down to the streets below; her eyes wandered to the procession, which was being headed by the Duke.

It was not until after looking her fill, when Viridia realized that her knees had long grown numb. "Alright. Let's go."

Viridia did not have a chance to clamber to her feet. A pair of forearms had seized her from behind and clasped her shoulders in a vice-like grip. She barely registered her chafing elbow before tasting something damp and flowery being pressed against her mouth.

A putrid scent began invading her nostrils. It was minty yet damp-smelling, very different from Cy's scent, which she also began to register as she came to. She lied on a warm metallic platform. Viridia was afraid to open her eyes, because it felt like a thousand lamp-lights were shining their beams directly at her.

The heat from the light shining in her face seemed to abate suddenly. It took awhile for Viridia's vision to adjust, and when it did, the silhouette of the man crouching in front of her came into focus.

The Duke's eyes were shrewd and the wrinkles beneath them showed his age and stress. His square-jawed face looked almost strained, maintaining that scrutinizing look that Viridia returned with equal dislike. "Arise," he said. His voice sounded deep and imperious, yet carried no hint of intimidation, even as he took out a giant double-bladed battle-ax.

The ropes binding Viridia's feet were severed and as were the ones binding her wrists. Her ears were filled with a metallic ringing. Viridia could only dimly hear the Duke address Cy. "Sir Marion. It's been quite a while."

Two more sharp metallic clangs resounded through the otherwise still air. Cy stood up and caught the scabbard concealing the Amber's Edge that the Duke tossed his way. Viridia scrambled onto her feet as the Duke approached. "Remove your hood," he commanded.

The audience gasped at Viridia backing away from the Duke. Cy shot her an imploring look. Slowly, her hands found the lacing on her cloak. She pulled her hands back and glared defiantly at the Duke.

He was dressed in a blue uniform that was of much finer cloth than the ones that the gate-guards wore; its buttons and the shovel insignia on the right breast were gold, beaming in the lamp-lights. His jet-black hair was streaked tersely with grey and was sleeked back down his broad back.

The Duke sized her up for several moments, then said, "Stranger. Tell me your name."

"Tell me yours, first," spat Viridia, to the outcry of the crowd, hidden in the glare of the lamp-lights. "All I keep hearing about you is that you're some sort of duke."

The Duke closed his eyes. "Fair point. My name is Duke Julius Riversend. I lead this city and its people. I now ask your name and your purpose for coming here."

"Ann Whitaker. As for your second question, I think you should ask Sir Marion," she said, putting sardonic emphasis on the last two words.

The Duke raised an eyebrow by a fraction of an inch, then turned towards Cy. "Well?"

"We've business in the library," replied Cy hurriedly. "I think your guards have sent a message to you?"

"If they have," drawled the Duke, "then... Oh?"

A falcon came fluttering down to rest upon a shoulder-guard of the Duke's uniform. Tearing a parchment from its talon, he examined it for a few seconds, then handed it to Cy. The falcon screeched and took flight at the snap of the Duke's fingers.

With a second snap, the Duke summoned a guard onto the stage. "Please escort these two guests to the rooftop of Rafflesia Heights," the Duke whispered into his ear. "They are not to leave your sight. Understood?" The guard nodded.

As Viridia and Cy were led out, the former looked over her shoulder to see Duke Riversend pacing back to the front of the stage, his veined arms crossed behind him. "This is another step further to defeating our sworn enemy, the Fallen One..."

Viridia and Cy found themselves once more upon the very same roof-top upon which they collapsed, this time joined by the Duke's man. "Please watch quietly," he insisted in a flat voice. "The Duke is to present something that will turn the tide against the Fallen One."

Although she rolled her eyes at these words, Viridia turned to watch, anyway. She was not surprised to see that the Duke was not presenting anything worth holding her breath over: a plain metal cross-bow.

"...when it glows white-hot," he was saying. "But notice now, the ruby set in the body of this cross-bow. As you can plainly see," he continued, waving it carelessly around him, "at the moment, it is --- "

The audience gasped. Even Viridia flinched even though she was almost a mile away; leaning against the ledge, she spoke to the Corias Solum guard over her shoulder. "What was that flash of light just now?" Cy was standing when it had happened; he also turned around to listen to the guard.

"The Duke was to present a weapon that through the efforts of the Corias Solum Research and Development Sector, has the ability to sense and destroy the Fallen. The sensor flashes white when the cross-bow happens to be aimed at a Fallen. Its specially-designed arrows pierce their fell hide."

Viridia and Cy looked at each other. "Silence," the Duke said in a loud carrying voice. The crowd that had been chatting and muttering anxiously fell silent; even Viridia and Cy stopped themselves voicing the suspicions they had at that moment. "I must consult my colleagues about this malfunction. Until then, this meeting is adjourned."

The blinding beams of light from the spotlights blinked out one-by-one after the Duke walked off the stage. Viridia noted the cross-bow, which was strapped on his back. She heard the crowd disperse, then stood up. "Where's the guard?" she asked Cy.

"Hm?" Cy turned around and scanned the rooftop of Rafflesia Heights. "I could have sworn he was just here. Why are you so concerned about him, anyway?" he asked curiously.

"Nothing. What's the plan, now?" said Viridia, indicating the library, whose wooden doors were now tightly shut. "I mean, we could break in, and --- "

"No," interrupted Cy. "We must wait until tomorrow. Right now, everyone's gone to sleep, and no one is tending the place." His voice was shaking slightly; his arms were rigid and his hands were balled into fists.

"Exactly," said Viridia smoothly. "So now's our chance."

"No," repeated Cy through clenched teeth. "We must retire to the Obsidian Rooms. The parchment the Duke handed me was a direct order that we stay the night there."

Without further ado, Cy grabbed Viridia arm and hoisted her onto his back. He jumped back down onto an alleyway with a thump, that in all the noise of the townspeople returning to their homes, went unnoticed. Viridia tried to prise her grip from Cy as he immersed himself into the crowd, but he was too strong.

They made their way towards an obelisk that was almost indistinguishable from the darkness of the night. Cy let Viridia off his back and withdrew the parchment. He pressed it to a glassy surface set against a smooth, stone wall, which parted to admit the two in. Viridia looked all around her as she followed Cy into the pitch-black foyer.

A lone, brightly lit elevator was open, as if waiting for them. "What is this thing?" asked Viridia as she stepped inside it. Cy got in after her, but said nothing.

Less than a minute later, Cy hurried out of the elevator as soon as the doors parted. He crossed a completely unlit corridor, save for the light spilling out a door-frame leading to a small apartment. He turned around just before the threshold and saw Viridia rooted to the elevator, still waiting stubbornly for an answer. "C'mon," said Cy impatiently.

Viridia pouted and folded her arms together. "Hmph." After crossing the corridor, nose in the air, the doors behind her slammed shut. "Okay, want to tell me what's going on?" But when Viridia turned around, Cy was gone. She wheeled around at the sound of another pair of slammed doors, from which she could now hear the muffled sounds of something like a small waterfall.

There was no knob, and Viridia found that the doors did not seem eager to prise themselves open at her touch. She called Cy through the door. After growing tired of expecting a muffled answer, Viridia allowed her eyes to wander the apartment.

Proceeding through the door-frame leading to one of the two brightly-lit bedrooms, Viridia turned around. On the wall beside the doorway was a glassy black surface like the one that Cy used to enter the building. She hummed shortly to herself before pressing her palm to it. Two slabs of metal protruded out the sides of the doorway and clamped shut. Viridia jumped back after the lock suddenly shone bright red; she stood frozen there, staring as it faded out.

On her right was a wooden coat-rack. After tossing her ruined cloak onto it, Viridia collapsed onto a fluffy white mattress. Once more, she begged the Book of Banes to respond, but to no avail. A small scrap of paper slipped out as she rifled through her book. Printed onto it was a small inked portrait of the Duke. A beep outside made her jump. Pulling her cloak over herself, Viridia looked from the door, to the glassy surface. It had learned to recognize her touch; a bright green light heated the flat of her palm.

The doors slid apart for Viridia. It was odd seeing Cy not dressed in rags, and odder still, for that stench that she'd grown accustommed to smelling when in his presence, to be replaced by some half-flowery, half-fruity scent. She was staring, mouth-open, at Cy's plain white tunic, underscored by a pair of straw-thatched shorts. "Oh, you found my F-note," he said, pointing at the scrap of paper in Viridia's hand.

"Huh?" she said blankly. "Your what?"

"It's money," replied Cy, "acceptable anywhere in Fimbluintt. I was wondering where it had gone."

Viridia tilted her head. "How much is it?"

"Well, that F-note is a thousand-unit note. A meal around these parts costs twenty units, and a night's stay at a fancy hotel, like this one costs about a hundred."

Viridia eyes widened in disbelief at the F-note. "But don't get your hopes up," continued Cy. "They're extremely rare, them. I sort of picked this one up while we were in that alleyway. It might be fake. You'd have to check for the watermark."

"The what?"

"Just... hold it up to the light," said Cy delicately. "There should be a small icon of the Corias Solum coat of arms. The Duke was wearing it this evening."

Holding the F-note up to the electric light, Viridia squinted her eyes. For several minutes, she struggled to look for an image of two shovels crossed underneath an asterisk. She was about to tell Cy that he had picked up a fake note, when something else on the note caught her eye. By the Duke's face, was some messy scrawl. Her eyes met Cy's.

"Well?" he said. "Can you see it, Ann?"

Viridia gave a firm nod.

"Whew," sighed Cy. "Now, we won't have to worry about scrounging about for breakfast money. We can find a tailor for your cloak while we're waiting for the library to open tomorrow. But right now, I'm beat."

Cy let out a loud yawn as he passed Viridia into the other bedroom. She was still staring straight ahead. After the doors clamped shut and after the familiar beep, Viridia frowned. She held the fake thousand F-note up to the light again.

In invisible ink, Cy had written: 'Being watched. Sewers safe.'
